dotfiles
========

## Introduction
A collection of my dotfiles.

## Discussion
I use a Mac, hence zsh is what I use everyday. So, you may want to check out [.zshrc][1]. On the contrary, [.bashrc][2] is mostly used for my Ubuntu VMs.  
Certain aliases in .zshrc refer to my shell scripts. They can be found [here][4].

I really like Vim, so make sure to check [.vimrc][3], too.

[1]: .zshrc
[2]: .bashrc
[3]: .vimrc
